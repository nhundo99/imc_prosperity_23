Problem:

different tradable goods with different trading quotes. Goal is to maximize the trading profit
and the constraints are that we have to start and end with the product seashells and also that
we can only make 5 trades maximum

solved the problem with the shortest path algorithm by djikstra
instead of multiplying the quotes we added the log(4-quotes) together
because the highest quote was 3.1
