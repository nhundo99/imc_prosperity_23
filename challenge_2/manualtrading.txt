problem:
we have a good that is tradable and a counterparty that wants to trade with the all the participants.
the counterparty however will only trade in the prices between 9000 and 11000 seashells.
and the counterparty will only trade with the 50% lowest offers
also the teams that traded with the counterparty will buy back the good at the average price
that the counterparty traded the good in the first place

solution:
we start by assuming a normal distribution of offers prices.
also i inlcude a percentage for teams that just don't want to loose money in this challenge
so these teams will offer the good at the highest possible price of 11000.
this will give us a mean price of around 10100 so we would offer our goods at slightly below 10100

Now we do this procedure multiple times assuming that for every further step
the amount of teams that will do this decreases.

I have read that we should do this about 3 times
