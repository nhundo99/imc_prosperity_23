    crispy cones:
        yesterday: 100 snowballs per crispy cone
        the next cones will be sold at a fixed price of 40'000 to icebuckets
            means 80 snowballs per crispy cone
        
        little bit weird since the price ice buckets will pay less but they will probably sell
        it again with a profit
